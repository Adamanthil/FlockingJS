This is a simple game that uses the Processing JS framework to demonstrate a variety of interactive flocking rules.

NB: USE FIREFOX!  There seems to be a problem with the webkit (ie Chrome & Safari) javascript engine rendering fonts in the canvas.  The game relies on some fonts.  Firefox displays them correctly, but Chrome and Safari do not.
